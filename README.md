# Doctor Listing Page - Campus Assessment

## Developed by: C. S. Hari Chandana

### Project Overview

This project is a *Doctor Listing Page*, developed as part of a campus assessment for a Frontend Developer role. In just 3 hours, I worked to implement a dynamic doctor search and listing page using React, which includes features such as an autocomplete search bar, dynamic filters, and sorting functionality. The goal was to build a functional, user-friendly page while focusing on the logic and interactivity of the filters and search.

### What I Did

- *Completed the Autocomplete Search*: Implemented a search bar with suggestions showing the top 3 doctor names based on the userâ€™s input.
- *Developed a Dynamic Filter Panel*: I added filters such as:
  - *Consultation Mode*: The ability to filter by consultation type (Video Consult vs. In Clinic).
  - *Specialties*: A multi-select checkbox filter to choose multiple specialties from a predefined list.
  - *Sorting*: Sorting functionality for doctors by fees (ascending) or experience (descending).
- *Client-Side Filtering*: Ensured that all filtering, searching, and sorting operations were done entirely on the client side after the initial API call. Applied URL query parameters to maintain the state when navigating back.
  
### Challenges Faced

- *Time Constraint*: With only 3 hours to complete the project, the biggest challenge was managing the time efficiently to implement all the required features and ensure everything worked as expected.
  
- *API Integration*: Fetching data from the provided API was straightforward, but integrating it with React and ensuring the filtering, search, and sort functionalities worked seamlessly on the frontend required careful attention to state management.

- *Client-Side Filtering*: Since the data needed to be filtered on the client side, I had to implement efficient filtering methods and ensure that all filters worked in combination, including sorting and specialty selection. I also had to make sure that the URL query parameters updated dynamically with the selected filters.

- *UI/UX Design*: Though UI design was not the focus, I still had to ensure that the page was user-friendly and functional. Handling multiple filter states and keeping track of them in the URL required careful planning to ensure a smooth user experience.

- *Testing*: Given the tight timeline, testing was limited. However, I made sure to test the main functionality, such as filtering, searching, and sorting, ensuring it worked without any issues.

### What I Learned

- *Efficiency in Frontend Development*: This project helped me hone my skills in quickly implementing frontend features while focusing on functionality.
- *Working Under Pressure*: It was a great experience working within a time constraint, learning how to prioritize features and focus on core functionalities.
- *React State Management*: Handling the state for dynamic filters and search functionalities in React taught me more about managing state effectively in larger applications.
